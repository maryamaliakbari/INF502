Title: Unsteady blood flow and mass transfer of a human left coronary artery bifurcation: FSI vs. CFD
Venue (journal name/conference): International Communications in Heat and Mass Transfer
Number of pages: 7 pages
3 outcomes of the paper:
# Exercise will decrease the concentration of the bad cholestrols near the artery wall and decreases the Atherosclerosis diseases compared to rest simulation.
# In the regions with the higher concentration the wall shear stress will decrease.
# In the exercise condition in the downstream of the stenosis the wall shear stress vectors are attracting toward the LCS line  and there are multi directions of wall shear stress vectors which shows they tend to decrease the concentration in these regions.
